# QR Detection

Two separate projects:

  -CV2 folder: it contains the QR detector based on OpenCV and pyzbar. More detailed instructions about it are included on its own readme file.
  -YOLO folder: it contains the QR detector based on a pre-trained model. More detailed instructions about it are included on its own readme file. It is highly suggested to use the detector+decoder version (i.e., the yolo-dbr-camera.py file).
